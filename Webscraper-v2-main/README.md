# The Issue
My issue with the previous web scraper consisted of the program's failure to process the list of names gathered from the Pinellas County Clerk of Court website. While this may have been an oversight when creating a pull request it has halted the flow of records entering circulation for a few weeks. When I reconnected the two parts of the program, it produced errors I couldn't fully debug.

# The Solution
Using the program as a base, I reconstructed the program to a version that works. I am not insinuating that it is perfect, but it should work until we can continue to improve further on it. 

Also, I added the Google Sheets API. Please send me your email so you would be able to auto-upload it to the documents. 

### p.s.
I may have gone a bit rouge on the comments.
